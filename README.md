# Build-Your-Own SQL Database (WIP)

This project is my attempt to **build a SQL database from scratch**, following the excellent [Build Your Own Database](https://build-your-own.org/database/#table-of-contents) tutorial.  

My goal is to deepen my understanding of how databases work under the hood, from parsing and query execution to storage and indexing.  

⚠️ **Note:** This project is still in very early development and is **not usable yet**. Expect incomplete features, breaking changes, and experimental code.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

- Understand the low-level data structures.  
- Implement a SQL-like query language.  
- Explore how transactions, concurrency, and durability are handled.  
- Gain deeper intuition for how production databases like SQLite, Postgres, and MySQL are built.
